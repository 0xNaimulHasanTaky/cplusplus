// In C++, the semicolon is a statement terminator.
// That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon.
// It indicates the end of one logical entity.
// For example, following are three different statements:

// x = y;
// y = y + 1;
// add(x, y);

// C++ does not recognize the end of the line as a terminator.
// For this reason, it does not matter where you put a statement in a line.
// For example:

// x = y;
// y = y + 1;
// add(x, y);

// is the same as

// x = y; y = y + 1; add(x, y);
