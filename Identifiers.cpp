// Identifiers
// Identifiers are names given to different user-defined entries such as variables{Variables.cpp}, structures, and functions, classes, objects, arrays, modules etc.
// Also, identifier names should have to be unique because these entities are used in the execution of the program.
// Identifier naming conventions:
// Only alphabetic characters starting with a letter (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_) are permitted.
// C++ does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers.
// The first letter must be an alphabet or underscore (_) not a number. Identifiers are case sensitive.
// Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers
// Reserved keywords{Keywords.cpp} can not be used as an identifier's name.
// Examples:
// mohd, zara, abc, move_name, a_123 myname50, _temp, j, a23b9, retVal
